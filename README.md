# Final Empirical Project
In this repositoray, I include my final project for the data science module. 
This project delves into job market data to uncover the most sought-after technical skills, with a focus on Python, Machine Learning, and SQL. 
Through detailed analysis and visualization using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project identifies trends and correlations, including a heatmap that shows how these skills are commonly paired in job descriptions. 
The insights gained can help professionals better understand industry needs and target their learning accordingly. 
To view the full analysis, you can clone this repository and run the Jupyter Notebook provided.
